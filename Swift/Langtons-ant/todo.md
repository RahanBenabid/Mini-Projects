- Add ANSITerminal as a dependency in your `Package.swift`.
- Implement your grid as a 2D array (e.g., `[Bool]` for black/white).
- Use ANSITerminal to clear and redraw the grid after each step.
- For animation, use a simple loop with a short sleep between steps.
- Optional: Use Argument Parser for user-configurable options.
